## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background

Fake news on social media platforms has become a critical threat to public discourse and democratic processes. Traditional detection systems primarily analyze text content alone, but modern misinformation employs sophisticated tactics including manipulated images, credible writing styles, and artificial social media amplification. The challenge requires a comprehensive approach that can analyze multiple data modalities simultaneously.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

Our primary objective was to develop a multi-modal fake news detection system that:
1. Achieves higher accuracy than existing text-only methods
2. Provides explainable predictions to promote media literacy
3. Analyzes text content, associated images, and social media behavior patterns
4. Offers practical deployment through a user-friendly web interface

### 1.3 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- Text analysis using transformer-based models (BERT)
- Image manipulation detection using deep learning (ResNet)
- Social media behavior analysis using machine learning algorithms
- Multi-modal fusion using neural networks
- Web-based demonstration system

**Limitations:**
- Limited to English language content
- Requires social media metadata for optimal performance
- Computational requirements may limit real-time deployment
- Dataset size constraints for some modalities

### 2.2 Image-Based Verification

Image manipulation detection has been addressed through:

- **Digital Forensics:** Error Level Analysis (ELA) and JPEG compression artifacts
- **Deep Learning:** CNN-based approaches using ResNet architectures (He et al., 2016)
- **Multi-scale Analysis:** Combining local and global features for manipulation detection

### 2.3 Social Media Analysis

Research in social media credibility has focused on:

- **Behavioral Patterns:** Posting frequency, engagement metrics, and bot detection

### 2.4 Multi-Modal Approaches

Limited prior work has attempted multi-modal fusion:

- **Early Fusion:** Concatenating features from different modalities
